# Modem Admin & Wi-Fi Passwords

## How to Change Your Modem/Router Admin and Wi-Fi Passwords

This guide covers changing both your modem/router admin password and updating Wi-Fi passwords for 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
networks. The instructions are general and apply to most home routers.

### Step 1: Find Your Modem/Router IP and Log In

- Open a web browser.
- Enter your modem/router's IP address in the address bar.
  Common defaults are [192.168.0.1](http://192.168.0.1) or [192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1).
  **Tip:** If unsure, check your deviceâ€™s label or look up the **Default Gateway** on your computer/network.
- Enter your current admin username and password. (Default credentials are often `admin/admin` unless previously
  changed.)
- When you firstly log in, it's advisable to change the default admin password for security.

### Step 2: Change the Admin Password

- Navigate to **Administration**, **Management**, **System Tools**, or **Maintenance** (menu names vary by model).
- Locate **Change Password** or **Password Settings**.
- Enter the current password, then the new password twice.
- Click **Save** or **Apply** to confirm.

### Step 3: Change Wi-Fi Passwords for 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz

- Go to **Wireless Settings** or **Wi-Fi Settings**.
- Find the **SSID (Network Name)** section for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.
- Locate the **Security / Password / Network Key** field.
- Enter your new Wi-Fi password for each band.
- Ensure both passwords are strong, using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Click **Save** or **Apply** to activate the changes.

### Step 4: Reconnect Devices

- After changing Wi-Fi passwords, reconnect all your devices using the new credentials.
- A modem/router restart is usually **not required**, but some models may recommend it.

### Tips for Strong Passwords

- Use a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Avoid personal info like names or birthdays.
- Keep your admin and Wi-Fi passwords different for better security.

### Security Note

- Keep a secure record of your new passwords.
- If passwords are forgotten, a factory reset of the modem/router may be required to regain access.
